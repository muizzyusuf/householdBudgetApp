# householdBudgetApp
A very basic house hold budget app. 
- user can input expenses and income as well as delete them
- user can set goals as well as delete them
- user can see a pie chart summary of income, expenditure, saved amount and done goals.
  - database functionality yet to be inplemented so all data is temporary and is stored using arraylists.
